	<h1>Engaging with the Contaminated</h1>
    <h2>"The Heart or the Head?" &#8212 answers to a long-standing debate.</h2>
    <p>
        In time, you will devise your own strategy and style for killing the zombies, but for now you need to be informed of the basics. Yes, the classic "headshot" will permanently put the enemy out of commission, as will a well-aimed chest shot. However, these are quite challenging targets, and you can't expect to hit them every time (or even most of the time &#8212 you're just a beginner!). But one thing that you do have on the invading fleet is speed: zombies are famously slow-moving. Use this to your advantage, and aim your weapon carefully and deliberately evert time.

    <h3>Although some zones are guaranteed kills, don't be discouraged by a wayward hit. Disabling the enemy is better than nothing! </h3>
