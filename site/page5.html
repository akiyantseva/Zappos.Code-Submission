	<h1>Your Potential Future</h1>
    <h2>Dealing with existential breakdowns, life crises, and other typical survivor problems.</h2>
    <p>
	Everyone you ever knew is probably a zombie at this point. If they aren't, they probably will be soon! And in the meantime, it falls on you &#8212 the well-informed peruser of this guide &#8212 to protect them from the dangerous world outside. This is a solemn and stressful duty. It's understandable if you feel a bit depressed or disaffected for a while, and thoughts such as "What is all of this for?" and "Will we ever be rescued?" and "Is human society as I knew it doomed?" are totally common. However, you have to push through this negativity and find the silver lining of your own situation!

    For example, the "romance developed under fire" must be a trope for a reason. If you were unluckly in love pre-apocalypse, perhaps you will have better luck with this new, totally fresh backdrop? After all, there aren't many living humans remaining: some nice fellow survivor might take a liking to you! Furthermore, this zombie invasion is also a prime opportunity to develop your business, or even to start a completely new one. With very little competition in the current market, you may even be able to establish a product monopoly (if you can deal with the lack of customers, of course).

    <h3>The end of of the world may be a prime opportunity for personal profit!</h3>
