	<h1>The Long-Term Surival Plan</h1>
    <h2>Are you in a safe zone?</h2>
    <p>
       Wow, look what a difference being properly armed makes! Now you can confidently scout your surroundings for opportune locations in which to set up a permanent base camp. You may be tempted to stay where you are &#8212 after all, it's gotten you past the initial stages of infection, right? Well, that's not quite right. If you're located in a free-standing house, you should consider whether you have enough essential supplies to sustain you through a probable 1-5 year zombie occupation. Do you have an all-season garden? A stockpile of food (and water, for when the tap stops running)? If the answer to these questions is no, then you absolutely cannot stay! If you are in an apartment building or an otherwise shared occupancy situation, leaving is absolutely essential &#8212 the neighbors will inevitably come to call, and they will almost certainly be zombies.

    <h3>Never compromise a zone that you know to be safe! </h3>
    <h3>Allowing "uncontaminated survivors" into your precious lair is a horror-movie cliche and definite <span class="italics">no-no</span>.</h3>
