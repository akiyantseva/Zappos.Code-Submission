    <h2>Find yourself a weapon:</h2>
    <p>
       Thanks to the modern film industry, there's no need to explain that zombies are violent, thoughtless creatures with no remaining vestiges of their previous lives! That's great! It leaves us time to discuss the essentials of survival: firstly and most importantly, obtaining a serviceable weapon. Many a survivor has been caught in the midst of an apocaplyse with just the frying pans in their kitchen and the gardening tools and their shed. These items are <span class = "italics"> not </span>acceptable for defending yourself from a full-on zombie attack. They're not made to withstand the damage of sustained contact &#8212 and make no mistake, if there were a way to kill a zombie gently, we would have found it by now!
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, to keep your Swedish knives sharp and your life safely guarded, you must scavenge around the safe zones of your surrounding area for something with the following qualities: sharp, sturdy, and with a long "handle" or ranged attacking ability (to prevent being bitten during your scruffle). If you already have weapons stocked, that's great! You are very well-prepared! However, make sure to be cautious and smart about who you reveal this valuable stockpile to &#8212 although zombies are your #1 enemy, remember that bad <span class ="italics">people</span> are still out there as well!
    </p>
    <h3>Good weapons include sharp, lengthy knives with hand guards, axes, and long shovels.</h3>
    <h3><span class = "italics">Ideal</span> weapons include guns of all sort, cross-bows, and latent magical powers.</h3>
